      <h1>About Myself</h1>
      <p>As a DevOps/Cloud Engineer, I specialize in bridging the gap between development and operations teams to streamline the software delivery process. I work to create an automated software delivery pipeline that enables teams to deploy code more quickly and reliably.</p>
      <p>To accomplish this, I utilize a variety of tools, including configuration management tools like Ansible, and infrastructure as code tools like Terraform and CloudFormation. I also have experience with containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, which enable teams to build and deploy applications in a consistent and reproducible way.</p>
      <p>As a DevOps Engineer, I am responsible for building and maintaining a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, which automates the testing, building, and deployment of code. This pipeline includes automated testing, code reviews, and automated deployment to production.</p>
      <p>In addition, I work to improve the observability of systems by implementing monitoring and logging solutions. This includes setting up dashboards and alerts to help teams quickly identify and resolve issues.</p>
      <p>Overall, my goal as a DevOps/Cloud Engineer is to enable development teams to deliver software more quickly and with greater reliability, while also ensuring that systems are secure, scalable, and highly available.</p>
